## Three Datasets :bread:

### Every obscenity and death in Quentin Tarantino's movies.

Since I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, I was attracted by the name of this database. The dataset records every time someone is cursed or bled out in a Quentin Tarantino movie and each datapoint has movie(movie name), type(genre of the movie), word(the specific profane word, if the event was a word) and minutes_in (the minute that the event occurred).
Imagination of the project: (x-axis minutes, y-axis numbers) graph by movie - adds on and turns into graph by movie genre - adds on and turn into one graph that counts all movies - then there would be a "play button", time goes, one second represents one minute in the movie, each second, datapoints shows and groups by "word"

### Boo!

The website Where’s The Jump aims “to provide a comprehensive listing of the jump scares in horror and thriller movies.” This dataset does not have data downloads, but there's a sheet listing all the 500+ movies with director, year of release, “jump count,” “jump scare rating,” availability on Netflix. 
Imagination of the project: I was attracted by this dataset because the idea of itself is really fun and I started to consider whether the web could be made into a jump scare.

### Sea Ice

Published by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the data files, which track ice coverage in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans, include daily and monthly measurements from November 1978 to the present.
Imagination of the project: The page can be really impressive and beautiful by creating the very theme-focus visualization for example let the datapoints be in the shape of sea ice and floating on the darkblue background.
